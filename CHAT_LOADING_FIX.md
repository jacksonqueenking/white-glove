# Chat Loading Issue - Fixed

## Problem

The chat interface was showing "Loading chat..." indefinitely on client and venue event pages.

## Root Cause

The `useCurrentUser` hook was importing the wrong Supabase client:

```typescript
// WRONG - This is server-side only
import { supabase } from '../db/supabaseClient';

// CORRECT - This is for browser/client-side
import { createClient } from '../supabase/client';
```

The `lib/db/supabaseClient.ts` file creates Supabase clients that are meant for server-side use (with `process.env` access), while client components need to use the SSR-compatible client from `lib/supabase/client.ts`.

## Fix Applied

**File: lib/hooks/useCurrentUser.tsx**

Changed:
```typescript
import { supabase } from '../db/supabaseClient';

// In the hook:
const { data: { user: authUser }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
```

To:
```typescript
import { createClient } from '../supabase/client';

// In the hook:
const supabase = createClient();
const { data: { user: authUser }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
```

## What This Fixes

✅ Chat will now properly load the authenticated user
✅ `useCurrentUser` hook will correctly identify user type (client/venue/vendor)
✅ ChatKit components will render properly
✅ AppShell will show the appropriate chat interface

## Testing

After this fix, you should see:

1. **If logged in as client** on event page:
   - `ClientEventChat` component loads
   - ChatKit UI appears

2. **If logged in as venue** on event page:
   - `VenueEventChat` component loads
   - ChatKit UI appears

3. **If logged in as venue** on dashboard:
   - `VenueGeneralChat` component loads
   - ChatKit UI appears

4. **If not logged in**:
   - "Please log in to access chat" message appears

## Debug Logs Added

Temporary console logging has been added to help diagnose:

**In useCurrentUser hook:**
- User loading start
- Auth result
- Database query results
- Final user state

**In AppShell:**
- Render state (loading, user, mode, eventId)

These can be removed once confirmed working.

## Next Steps

1. Test the pages - chat should now load
2. Check browser console for debug logs
3. If working, remove debug console.log statements
4. If still not working, check console logs for specific errors
