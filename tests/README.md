# Testing Strategy

The `tests/unit` and `tests/integration` folders are placeholders for the coverage plan:
- `unit/`: Pure function and component tests (forms, task helpers, messaging formatters).
- `integration/`: Higher-level orchestration, API route, and workflow tests that exercise Supabase and Stripe mocks.

Add testing utilities (e.g., Supabase test harness, orchestrator fixtures) alongside the suites as implementation begins.
