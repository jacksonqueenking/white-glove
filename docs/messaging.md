# Messaging System Documentation

## Overview

The platform has two distinct communication systems that serve different purposes. Understanding this distinction is critical to implementing and using the system correctly.

---

## Two Communication Systems

### 1. Chats (AI Conversations)

**What they are:**
- Conversations between users and AI assistants
- Powered by LLMs (Large Language Models)
- Context-aware and can take actions via tools
- Have memory and persistent history

**Who has them:**
- ‚úÖ **Clients:** Chat with AI assistant to plan their event
- ‚úÖ **Venues:** Chat with AI assistant to manage events and coordinate
- ‚ùå **Vendors:** Do NOT have AI chat assistants

**Where they appear:**
- Client Event Page: Chat interface on left side of split screen
- Venue Event Page: Chat interface in center/main area
- Sidebar: List of recent chat conversations for quick access

**What they can do:**
- Answer questions
- Make suggestions
- Execute actions (update data, create tasks, send messages)
- Remember past conversations
- Provide context-specific help

---

### 2. Messages (Human-to-Human)

**What they are:**
- Direct communication between people
- Traditional messaging like email or SMS
- Can include AI-generated suggestions for responses

**Who uses them:**
- Clients ‚Üî Venues
- Venues ‚Üî Vendors
- (Clients do NOT directly message vendors; venue mediates)

**Where they appear:**
- **Venue:** Dedicated Messages Page with list of threads
- **Vendor:** Dedicated Messages Page with list of threads
- **Client:** Messages sent via AI assistant (AI sends on client's behalf)

**What they're for:**
- Specific questions or requests
- Formal communication
- Vendor coordination
- Client inquiries that need direct attention

---

## Chat System Details

### Client Chat Interface

**What clients can do through their AI assistant:**
- Ask questions about their event
- Request changes to elements
- Get suggestions for vendors
- Manage their guest list
- View pricing and budget
- Review contracts
- Message the venue (AI sends on their behalf)

**Context the AI has:**
- Client's information and preferences
- Event details (date, venue, guest count, budget)
- Selected elements and their status
- Venue information and available services
- Past conversation history
- Past event history (if returning client)

**Example conversation:**
```
Client: "I think we need more vegetarian options for dinner"

AI: "I can help with that! Your current menu has one vegetarian 
option. Would you like me to ask the caterer about adding more? 
I can suggest:
- Vegetarian lasagna
- Stuffed portobello mushrooms
- Eggplant parmesan

Which would you prefer, or would you like to see all options?"

Client: "Show me all options"

AI: [Displays options with photos and pricing]

Client: "Let's add the portobello mushrooms"

AI: "Great choice! I'll send a request to the venue to confirm 
this addition with the caterer. The additional cost would be 
about $8 per vegetarian meal. You should hear back within 24 hours."

[AI creates task for venue to confirm with caterer]
```

---

### Venue Chat Interface

**What venues can do through their AI assistant:**
- Review event status across all events
- Get reminders about pending tasks
- Ask for summaries or reports
- Manage elements for events
- Coordinate vendor communications
- Send messages to clients or vendors
- Update event information

**Context the AI has:**
- Venue information
- All event details
- Client information for all events
- Vendor relationships and information
- Complete task list
- Full action history
- All message threads

**Example conversation:**
```
Venue: "What's the status of the Smith wedding?"

AI: "The Smith wedding is on October 15. Current status:
‚úì Venue rental - confirmed
‚úì Catering - confirmed (Bella's Catering)
üü° Photography - waiting for vendor confirmation
‚ö´ Flowers - client reviewing options
You have 1 pending task: Confirm final catering count by Oct 8"

Venue: "Send a reminder to the photographer"

AI: "I'll send a message to Lens & Light Photography asking 
for confirmation. Would you like me to mention any specific 
deadline?"

Venue: "Yes, we need confirmation by Friday"

AI: "Done! I've sent the message with a Friday deadline and 
created a follow-up task in case we don't hear back."
```

### Why Vendors Don't Have AI Chat

**Design Decision:**
Vendors are service providers working with multiple venues. Their needs are different:

**What vendors need:**
- Clear specifications for what's being requested
- Ability to respond to specific requests
- Simple, direct communication

**What they don't need:**
- AI assistant asking them questions
- Another "interface" to learn
- Complex conversation management

**Instead, vendors:**
- Receive clear messages from venue AI representatives
- View straightforward event specifications
- Respond directly through message threads
- Complete structured forms when needed

---

## Message System Details

### Message Threading

**How messages are organized:**
- Messages are grouped into **threads**
- Each thread has a subject and list of participants

## AI-Initiated Messages

### When AI Sends Messages on Behalf of Users

The AI assistants can send messages on behalf of users in certain situations:

#### Client AI ‚Üí Venue

**When:**
- Client requests something through chat
- Client asks to "tell the venue" something
- Client approves/rejects something
- Automated reminders or confirmations

**Example:**
Client tells their AI: "Can we add another table?"
‚Üí AI creates message thread to venue: "Client requests to add one additional table to their event. Current count: 15 tables for 150 guests."

#### Venue AI ‚Üí Vendor

**When:**
- Venue asks AI to contact vendor
- Client request needs vendor action
- Automated confirmations or requests

**Example:**
Venue tells their AI: "Ask the florist about pink roses"
‚Üí AI creates message thread to florist: "For the Smith wedding on Oct 15, the client would like to explore adding pink roses to the arrangements. Can you provide options and pricing?"

#### Venue AI ‚Üí Client

**When:**
- Status updates
- Confirmations
- Responses to client requests

**Example:**
After vendor confirms: AI sends to client: "Good news! The florist confirmed they can add pink roses to your arrangements for an additional $150. Would you like to approve this change?"
