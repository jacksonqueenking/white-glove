# Payment Processing Documentation

## Overview

The platform uses Stripe for all payment processing. Payments are straightforward: clients pay for their events, funds are held by the platform, and venues receive payouts after events. This document describes the payment concepts, user flows, and requirements.

## Payment Architecture

### Payment Flow

```
Client â†’ Stripe Checkout â†’ Platform
                              â†“
                          (holds funds)
                              â†“
                            Venue
                              â†“
                    (pays vendors separately)
```

**v1.0 Scope:**
- Clients pay via Stripe
- Platform holds funds and takes fees
- Venues paid via Stripe Connect
- Vendors paid by venues outside platform

**Future:**
- Direct vendor payments through platform
- Split payments to multiple parties
- Escrow services

## Payment Concepts

### Events Have Multiple Payable Items

Each event has elements (venue rental, catering, photography, etc.). Each element may have:
- Base price
- Payment schedule (deposit, installments, final payment)
- Different due dates
- Different vendors

**Example Event Breakdown:**
- Venue rental: $2,500 (due 60 days before)
- Catering: $8,000 (50% deposit 30 days before, rest 7 days before)
- Photography: $2,000 (full payment 14 days before)

### Deposit Rules

Venues and vendors can configure deposit requirements:
- **Deposit percentage** (e.g., 50%)
- **When deposit is due** (e.g., 60 days before event)
- **Minimum deposit amount** (e.g., at least $500)
- **Installment options** (allow splitting payments)

**System automatically calculates payment schedules based on these rules.**

## Payment Schedules

### How Schedules Work

When an element is added to an event:
1. System checks deposit rules for that venue/vendor
2. Calculates payment schedule automatically
3. Sets due dates based on event date
4. Creates payment tasks/reminders

**Example Calculation:**
- Element: Catering, $6,000
- Rule: 50% deposit, 30 days before event
- Event date: October 15
- Result:
  - Deposit: $3,000 due by September 15
  - Final: $3,000 due by October 8

### Payment Reminders

**Automatic reminders sent:**
- 7 days before due date (email)
- 3 days before due date (email + in-app)
- 1 day before due date (email + in-app)
- Day of due date (email + in-app, marked urgent)
- After due date (daily reminders, escalation)

## Failed Payments

### When Payments Fail

**Common reasons:**
- Insufficient funds
- Card expired
- Card declined by bank
- Payment method issue

**What happens:**
1. Client sees error message
2. Client can retry immediately
3. Venue notified of failure
4. Task created for venue to follow up
5. Automated retry after 3 days (optional)
6. If still failing, venue contacts client directly

### Preventing Payment Issues

**Best practices:**
- Send reminders well in advance
- Allow multiple payment methods
- Clear error messages
- Easy retry process
- Venue can mark as "paid offline" if needed

---

## Security & Compliance

### PCI Compliance

**Critical rule: Platform never stores card data.**

**How this works:**
- Stripe Checkout handles all card input
- Card data goes directly to Stripe
- Platform only stores Stripe IDs (safe tokens)
- No card numbers, CVVs, etc. ever in our database

**Stripe is PCI DSS Level 1 certified** - highest security standard.

### Data Protection

**What we store:**
- Stripe customer IDs (safe)
- Stripe payment intent IDs (safe)
- Payment amounts and dates
- Payment status

**What we never store:**
- Card numbers
- CVV codes
- Full card data

### Fraud Prevention

**Stripe handles:**
- Fraud detection
- 3D Secure authentication
- Velocity checks
- Machine learning fraud models

**Platform handles:**
- User authentication
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging
- Unusual activity monitoring

---

## Payment Tracking & Reporting

### For Clients

**Payment dashboard shows:**
- Upcoming payments with due dates
- Payment history with receipts
- Total spent
- Outstanding balance
- Download statements

### For Venues

**Financial dashboard shows:**
- Revenue by event
- Pending payouts
- Payment history
- Commission/fee breakdown
- Outstanding payments from clients

### For Platform

**Analytics track:**

---

## Special Cases

### Offline Payments

Sometimes clients pay outside the platform (check, wire transfer, etc.).

**Process:**
1. Client pays venue directly
2. Venue marks payment as "received offline" in system
3. System updates payment status
4. No Stripe transaction, no platform fee
5. Recorded for tracking purposes

### Payment Plans

**Future feature:** Allow clients to split payments into installments.

**Concept:**
- Client selects "payment plan" option
- System calculates equal installments
- Automatic charges on schedule
- Interest optional (configurable)

### Multi-Currency

**Future feature:** Support international payments.

**v1.0:** USD only
**Future:** Detect client location, offer local currency
