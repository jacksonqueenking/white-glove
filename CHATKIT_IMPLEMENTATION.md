# ChatKit and AgentKit Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

We have successfully integrated OpenAI's ChatKit and AgentKit into the White Glove event management platform, replacing custom chat components with OpenAI's production-ready solution.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Installed

```bash
npm install @openai/chatkit-react @openai/agents zod@3
```

- **@openai/chatkit-react**: React bindings for ChatKit UI
- **@openai/agents**: OpenAI's Agents SDK for backend logic
- **zod@3**: Runtime schema validation (required by Agents SDK)

### 2. New Files Created

#### API Routes
- **app/api/chatkit/session/route.ts**
  - Creates ChatKit sessions with short-lived tokens
  - Handles authentication via Supabase
  - Supports multiple agent types (client, venue_general, venue_event)
  - Includes fallback for development without workflows

#### Components
- **components/chat/ChatKitWrapper.tsx**
  - Base wrapper component for ChatKit integration
  - Handles session token management
  - Configures theme and start screen
  - Loads ChatKit JavaScript

- **components/chat/ClientEventChat.tsx**
  - Client-facing chat interface
  - Uses client agent

- **components/chat/VenueEventChat.tsx**
  - Venue event-specific chat interface
  - Uses venue_event agent

- **components/chat/VenueGeneralChat.tsx**
  - Venue-wide operations chat interface
  - Uses venue_general agent

#### Agent System
- **lib/agents/agentSDK.ts**
  - Integrates existing agent definitions with OpenAI's Agents SDK
  - Creates agents with tools and instructions
  - Converts OpenAI tool format to Agents SDK tool format
  - Provides functions to create each agent type

#### Utilities
- **lib/hooks/useCurrentUser.tsx**
  - React hook to get current user info
  - Determines user type (client/venue/vendor)
  - Provides user IDs for agent context

#### Documentation
- **docs/chatkit-setup.md**
  - Complete setup guide
  - Architecture documentation
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Migration notes

- **CHATKIT_IMPLEMENTATION.md** (this file)
  - Implementation summary
  - Testing instructions
  - Next steps

### 3. Modified Files

#### components/layout/AppShell.tsx
- Updated to use ChatKit components instead of custom chat UI
- Added logic to render appropriate agent based on:
  - User type (client/venue)
  - Current route (eventId)
  - Application mode
- Integrated useCurrentUser hook for user context

### 4. Existing Agent Infrastructure (Used)

Your existing agent system has been integrated:

✅ **lib/agents/prompts.ts** - System prompt generators
✅ **lib/agents/tools.ts** - Tool definitions (OpenAI format)
✅ **lib/agents/context.ts** - Context builders
✅ **lib/agents/toolHandlers.ts** - Tool execution handlers

These were already well-structured and compatible with OpenAI's standards!

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram

```
User opens event page
         │
         ▼
    AppShell determines agent type
    (based on mode and eventId)
         │
         ▼
    Appropriate ChatKit component renders
    (ClientEventChat / VenueEventChat / VenueGeneralChat)
         │
         ▼
    ChatKitWrapper requests session token
         │
         ▼
    POST /api/chatkit/session
    - Authenticates user via Supabase
    - Determines agent type and context
    - Creates ChatKit session with OpenAI
    - Returns client_secret
         │
         ▼
    ChatKit UI loads and connects
    - Uses client_secret for auth
    - Connects to OpenAI's ChatKit service
    - Displays chat interface
         │
         ▼
    User sends message
         │
         ▼
    OpenAI Agent processes message
    - Uses system prompt (from prompts.ts)
    - Has access to tools (from tools.ts)
    - Has context (from context.ts)
    - Executes tools via handlers (toolHandlers.ts)
         │
         ▼
    Response streamed to UI
```

## Environment Setup Required

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...

# Optional (for production with Agent Builder workflows)
OPENAI_WORKFLOW_ID_CLIENT=workflow_...
OPENAI_WORKFLOW_ID_VENUE_GENERAL=workflow_...
OPENAI_WORKFLOW_ID_VENUE_EVENT=workflow_...
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Local Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Set environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Client Chat

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/client/event/[some-event-id]`
2. You should see the ChatKit interface in the left sidebar
3. Try sending a message like:
   - "What elements do I have selected?"
   - "Add a guest named John Smith"
   - "What tasks do I need to complete?"

Expected behavior:
- Chat interface loads
- Messages are sent and responses received
- Agent has context about the event
- Tools can be called (you'll see database operations)

### 3. Test Venue Event Chat

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/venue/events/[event-id]`
2. ChatKit should load with venue_event agent
3. Try messages like:
   - "What's the status of this event?"
   - "Create a task for the client to confirm guest count"
   - "Show me the guest list"

### 4. Test Venue General Chat

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/venue/dashboard`
2. ChatKit should load with venue_general agent
3. Try messages like:
   - "List all my upcoming events"
   - "Show me vendors pending approval"
   - "What tasks are overdue?"

### 5. Verify Agent Context

The agent should know:
- ✅ Current event details
- ✅ Selected elements and pricing
- ✅ Guest lists and RSVPs
- ✅ Pending tasks
- ✅ Recent actions
- ✅ Available offerings

### 6. Test Tool Execution

Tools should work:
- ✅ Adding elements to events
- ✅ Managing guests
- ✅ Creating/completing tasks
- ✅ Sending messages
- ✅ Updating event status

Check server console for tool execution logs.

## Known Limitations & Development Notes

### 1. Workflow IDs (Optional)

The system works without Agent Builder workflows using a fallback mode. For production:

1. Create workflows in OpenAI Agent Builder
2. Add workflow IDs to environment variables
3. The session API will use them automatically

### 2. Session Management

- Sessions are created per page load
- Session IDs are stored in cookies
- Tokens are short-lived and refreshed automatically by ChatKit

### 3. Real-time Updates

ChatKit handles streaming and real-time responses. Database changes from tools are immediate but won't update the chat context until the next message (this is expected behavior).

### 4. Error Handling

- Tool errors are caught and returned as error messages
- Session creation failures fall back to development mode
- Missing user/auth shows "Loading chat..." state

## Migration Notes

### Old Components (Can Be Removed)

These are no longer used:
- `components/chat/ChatWindow.tsx`
- `components/chat/BaseChatWindow.tsx`
- `components/venue/VenueChatWindow.tsx`

### Keep These

These are now integrated:
- ✅ `lib/agents/*` - All agent logic
- ✅ `lib/db/*` - All database functions
- ✅ `components/chat/ChatHistoryList.tsx` - Still used in AppShell

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Production)

1. **Create Agent Builder Workflows**
   - Create 3 workflows (client, venue_general, venue_event)
   - Configure with your prompts and tools
   - Add workflow IDs to environment variables

2. **Test All Features**
   - Go through each user flow
   - Test all tools
   - Verify permissions
   - Check error handling

3. **Add Monitoring**
   - Log agent interactions
   - Monitor tool usage
   - Track errors and failures
   - Set up alerts for critical errors

### Future Enhancements

1. **Conversation History**
   - Store conversation history in database
   - Allow users to view past conversations
   - Resume conversations across sessions

2. **Advanced Context**
   - Add more real-time data to context
   - Include venue policies and rules
   - Add historical patterns and preferences

3. **Custom Widgets**
   - ChatKit supports custom widgets
   - Add interactive elements (buttons, forms, etc.)
   - Create rich media responses

4. **Multi-agent Coordination**
   - Coordinate between client and venue agents
   - Share context across agents
   - Implement handoffs

5. **Analytics**
   - Track most common queries
   - Identify tool usage patterns
   - Measure response quality
   - Optimize prompts based on data

## Architecture Decisions

### Why ChatKit?

1. **Production-Ready UI**: Handles streaming, threading, history
2. **Built-in Features**: Attachments, sources, widgets
3. **Maintained by OpenAI**: Updates and improvements
4. **Easy Integration**: Drop-in replacement for custom chat

### Why Agents SDK?

1. **Standardized Tools**: OpenAI's tool format
2. **Provider Agnostic**: Can switch LLM providers
3. **Built-in Features**: Handoffs, structured output
4. **Best Practices**: OpenAI's recommended patterns

### Why Separate Agents?

1. **Context Size**: Each agent has focused context
2. **Tool Access**: Different capabilities per role
3. **Performance**: Smaller context = faster responses
4. **Security**: Role-based permissions

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Failed to create session"

Check:
- OPENAI_API_KEY is set
- User is authenticated
- Console for specific errors

### Chat shows "Loading..."

Check:
- useCurrentUser is returning user data
- Database has user in correct table
- No JavaScript errors in console

### Tools not executing

Check:
- Server console for errors
- Tool handler permissions
- Database connection
- Zod validation

### Agent doesn't have context

Check:
- Context builders are fetching data
- System prompts include data
- Database queries are working
