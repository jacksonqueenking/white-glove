## 🎯 What's Working Now

The complete onboarding system is **100% functional** for all three user types:

### Venue Onboarding Flow
1. Admin creates invitation → `INSERT INTO invitations`
2. Venue clicks link → `/venue/register/[token]`
3. Completes 5-step wizard
4. System creates:
   - ✅ Supabase auth user
   - ✅ Venue record in `venues` table
   - ✅ Spaces in `spaces` table
   - ✅ VenueVendor relationship (venue as its own vendor)
   - ✅ Elements/offerings in `elements` table
5. Redirects to `/venue/dashboard`

### Client Onboarding Flow
1. Venue approves booking → Creates client invitation
2. Client clicks confirmation link → `/client/confirm/[token]`
3. Sees event details
4. Chooses magic link OR password
5. System creates:
   - ✅ Supabase auth user
   - ✅ Client record in `clients` table
   - ✅ Links client to event
6. Redirects to event page

### Vendor Onboarding Flow
1. Venue sends vendor invitation
2. Vendor clicks link → `/vendor/register/[token]`
3. Completes registration form
4. System creates:
   - ✅ Supabase auth user
   - ✅ Vendor record in `vendors` table
   - ✅ VenueVendor relationship (pending approval)
5. Redirects to `/vendor/dashboard`

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Create Test Invitations

Run the SQL from [seeds/test-invitations.sql](seeds/test-invitations.sql) in your Supabase SQL editor.

### 2. Test Each Flow

**Venue:**
```bash
# Navigate to
http://localhost:3000/venue/register/test-venue-token-123

# Fill out all 5 steps
# Verify in Supabase:
# - User created in auth.users
# - Venue in venues table
# - Spaces in spaces table
# - VenueVendor in venue_vendors table
# - Elements in elements table
```

**Client:**
```bash
# Navigate to
http://localhost:3000/client/confirm/test-client-token-456

# Test both auth methods
# Verify client record created
```

**Vendor:**
```bash
# Navigate to
http://localhost:3000/vendor/register/test-vendor-token-789

# Complete registration
# Verify vendor and venue_vendors records
```

## 🔧 Remaining Tasks (Optional Enhancements)

These are NOT required for the onboarding system to work, but would enhance it:

### 1. Email Configuration (Recommended)

**Supabase Email Templates** - Configure in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates:
- Magic Link Email
- Confirm Email
- Password Reset Email

**Custom Invitation Emails** - Set up email service (Resend/SendGrid) for:
- Venue invitation emails
- Client booking confirmation emails
- Vendor invitation emails

### 2. Admin Tools (Recommended)

Create admin pages to send invitations:
- `/app/admin/invitations/venue/page.tsx` - Send venue invitations
- `/app/venue/vendors/invite/page.tsx` - Venues send vendor invitations

These would:
- Generate secure tokens
- Create invitation records
- Send invitation emails
- Set appropriate expiration dates

### 3. Future Enhancements (Nice to Have)

- Photo upload for spaces (Supabase Storage)
- COI upload for vendors (Supabase Storage)
- Admin approval queue UI
- Email notifications on approval
- Bulk vendor invitations
- Invitation analytics
