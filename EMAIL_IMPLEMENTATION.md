## Implementation Files

### Core Email Module
**File**: `lib/email/resend.ts`

Contains:
- `sendEmail()` - Base email sending function
- `sendNewInquiryNotification()` - Venue notification
- `sendInquiryApprovalEmail()` - Client approval email
- `sendInquiryDeclineEmail()` - Client decline email

### Integration Points

1. **Inquiry Submission** ([app/api/inquiries/route.ts](app/api/inquiries/route.ts))
   ```typescript
   await sendNewInquiryNotification({
     venueName,
     venueEmail,
     clientName,
     eventDate,
     eventTime,
     guestCount,
     referenceNumber,
   });
   ```

2. **Approval** ([app/api/inquiries/[inquiryId]/approve/route.ts](app/api/inquiries/[inquiryId]/approve/route.ts))
   ```typescript
   await sendInquiryApprovalEmail({
     clientName,
     clientEmail,
     venueName,
     eventDate,
     eventTime,
     spaceNames,
     guestCount,
     venueNotes,
     confirmationToken,
   });
   ```

3. **Decline** (same file)
   ```typescript
   await sendInquiryDeclineEmail({
     clientName,
     clientEmail,
     venueName,
     eventDate,
     declineReason,
     alternativeDates,
   });
   ```

## Error Handling

All email sending is wrapped in try-catch blocks:
- Logs errors to console
- **Does not fail the request** if email fails
- Allows the flow to continue even if email service is down

```typescript
try {
  await sendInquiryApprovalEmail({...});
} catch (emailError) {
  console.error('Error sending approval email:', emailError);
  // Don't fail the request if email fails
}
```

## Testing Emails

### Local Development

1. Set `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev` for testing
2. Emails will be sent to the test inbox
3. Check Resend dashboard for sent emails

### Production

1. Verify your domain in Resend
2. Update `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` to use your verified domain
3. Set in Vercel environment variables

## Email Flow Diagram

```
Client Submits Inquiry
    â†“
ðŸ“§ Venue gets "New Inquiry" email â†’ Venue reviews in dashboard
    â†“
Venue Approves
    â†“
ðŸ“§ Client gets "Booking Confirmed" email with account creation link
    â†“

OR

## Customization

To customize email templates, edit the HTML in `lib/email/resend.ts`. The templates use:
- Inline CSS for maximum compatibility
- Table-based layouts for email client support
- Gradient backgrounds for visual appeal
- Responsive design with mobile breakpoints

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add email preview/test endpoints
- [ ] Create reminder emails (24 hours before expiry)
- [ ] Add email templates for other flows (vendor invites, etc.)
- [ ] Support for email attachments (contracts, etc.)
- [ ] Email analytics tracking (opens, clicks)
- [ ] Scheduled email sending
- [ ] Email templates in admin dashboard for venue customization

## Troubleshooting

### Email not sending

1. Check `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. Verify `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` is either `onboarding@resend.dev` (testing) or a verified domain
3. Check Resend dashboard for errors
4. Look at server logs for error messages

### Email going to spam

1. Verify your domain in Resend
2. Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
3. Use a proper from address (not `noreply@`)
4. Ensure content doesn't trigger spam filters

### Styling issues

1. Email clients have limited CSS support
2. Always use inline styles
3. Use tables for layout (not flexbox/grid)
4. Test in multiple email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
