# Components Directory

React components shared across the client, venue, and vendor applications live here. Subfolders group components by feature area described in the product specs:
- `chat/`: Conversational UI building blocks used in AI-assisted experiences.
- `event/`: Event overview widgets (element stacks, status cues, schedules).
- `forms/`: Dynamic form rendering for orchestrator-generated schemas.
- `layout/`: Shells and navigation primitives per persona.
- `messages/`: Thread and message presentation for human-to-human communication.
- `payments/`: Billing and checkout UI fragments.
- `tasks/`: Task lists, detail panels, and status indicators.
- `shared/`: Cross-cutting primitives (buttons, loading states, icons).

Placeholders illustrate expected responsibilities so implementation can follow the workflows documented in `/docs`.
