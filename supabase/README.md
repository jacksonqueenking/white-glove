# Supabase Resources

This directory will store SQL migrations, edge functions, and configuration required for the Supabase backend described in the schema and authentication docs. Add database migration scripts under `supabase/migrations`, seed data under `supabase/seeds`, and any reusable SQL helpers or RLS policy definitions here.
